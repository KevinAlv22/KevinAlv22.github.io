title: Week 10 (7/22/24 - 7/26/24)
---

This is our final week and we got to focus on wrapping up any remaining autograders. I had two course2 autograders remaining, one that was already in faculty code review and the other still in development. The autograder that was still in development was a lab about students simulating a store with for loops and the range function. There were many edge cases and I had to rely on a student function to figure out what items they are using their store. Once grabbing these items, I can then test their other functions with these items as input. While working on these autograders, I did spend some time writing the manuscript for our weekly meeting. The main feedback I got was to include an appendix section that featured all the questions that I would ask in my survey. I was able to complete the faculty code review for one of the course2 autograders and merged it into the main branch. I did finish the other autograder and it is in faculty code review! This was an amazing research experience and I got to learn a lot of things. I learned how to read reseach papers, how to write papers, and how to develop open-ended autograders! I am thankful for my mentors and my team!
