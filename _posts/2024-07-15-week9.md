title: Week 9 (7/15/24 - 7/19/24)
---

This week I wrapped up faculty code review for another Course1 autograder. This one went through multiple rounds of code review as they presented new edge cases and potential student solutions to consider. This helped me improve the quality of the autograder. A new issue did arise this week and that was a bug in the course1 autograder template. It was one line that needed to be changed in order to properly read and execute the student's program. So I had to implement this change in this autograder and the one from last week (that was already merged in the git branch). I was able to resolve the merge conflict and successfully merged these two autograders into the main branch! Our meeting this week was focused on going over our written out methods section for our manuscript. The feedback I recieved was to edit the questions in my survey to be more aligned with my research question. The task for next week is to write out a manuscript for our meeting and continue working on a course2 autograder.
