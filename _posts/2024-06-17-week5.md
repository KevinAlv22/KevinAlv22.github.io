title: Week 5 (6/17/24 - 6/21/24)
---

This week was focused on working on my next solo autograder. This autograder is for a lab that focuses on using while loops and indexing to create art from input patterns. This lab also focused on getting students used to the new line character as well as using conditional statements. There were some edge cases and considerations to alter the assignment instructions to make it clearer and to allow for more creativity. I was able to finish the test cases and moved it to peer review. Also, this week's meeting focused on going over our research proposal from UR2PhD with our Professors. It was declared that our proposal was in good condition and that it's time to start moving towards writing our own research paper. We were tasked with desining our own specific research questions for next week's meeting as well as continuing our work on current autograders. One thing I noticed was that our code template struggled with capturing certain characters, so I brought this up and we worked to fix it.
