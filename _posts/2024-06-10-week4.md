title: Week 4 (6/10/24 - 6/14/24)
---

This week was focused on starting a new group autograder while also wrapping up the UR2PhD research class. The new autograder was focused on debugging, where students were given the chance to take faulty code and alter it. Our autograder focused on detecting which changes students made and if their changed program presented any errors. We were able to finish this as a group and moved it to code review with the Professors. For the UR2PhD course, we finished our research proposal based on feedback given from a peer review process with our classmates. We also created and recorded an 8 minute presentation going over our efforts so far and our next steps. Also, I started to transition to a new solo autograder that is based on while loops again. The research proposal is linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dH3VuL6m7FQyZuYC1SmrftsGSCE4N-ml/view?usp=drive_link).
