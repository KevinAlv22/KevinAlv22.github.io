title: Week 3 (6/03/24 - 6/07/24)
---

This week was more focused on working and completing my first individual autograder. This autograder was for a lab focused on students creating art output using a while loop. I noticed many things while working on this autograder. This included things like the different types of errors students could make, changes to lab instructions to be more open-ended, and how autograders are constantly changing. There were a large number of edge cases that were brought up in our meetings for this week. I was able to address all of these edge cases and moved the code for this autograder into peer review. I was able to complete peer review and move the code into faculty review. I have also read two papers this week more focused on different types of autograders.
