title: Week 8 (7/08/24 - 7/12/24)
---

This week was focused on completing the peer code review process with my teammates for my first Course2 autograder. I also completed the Professor code review for one of my previous autograders this week. I was able to squash and merge this autograder into the main branch in GitHub. I still had two other autograders this week that were in the Professor code review process and I was able to work on those. Their comments were mostly about formatting and some edge cases that I could consider. This did introduce some bugs in my code but I was able to reorganize the test functions in order to fix this issue. In this week's meeting, we went over research paper outlines. The overall feedback was that my current outline is in a good position but it would be benificial to shorten the survey questions used for my methods section. Also, I need to include more sources in my related work section and introduction section. The task for next week's meeting is to formally write our methods section with the feedback we got this week. I was also assigned a new Course2 autograder and this one focuses on students using functions to simulate shopping at a store.
