## About Me

My name is Kevin Alvarenga, and I am a rising senior at Duke University. I am scheduled to graduate Spring 2025 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I am currently planning on applying to graduate school to potentially earn a PhD in Computer Science. I got interested in Computer Science after taking an introductory course here at Duke. I loved this class and am currently an undergraduate teacher assistant for it! This has sparked another interest in CS Education and I hope to enter academia in the future! In my free time, I like to listen to music, walk my dogs, and play soccer with friends. Please reach out to me at my email: kalvarenga3088@gmail.com or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-alvarenga-2a2454292/).
